# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction


• Due to COVID-19 one of the hardest hit industries is the airline industry,
but as soon as we get past this pandemic, there will be a surge in the
demand for the airline industry.

• Our project helps to give airlines a competitive edge when the expected
surge arrives by building a predictive model based on the previous surveys
data.

• Our aim of the project is to predict whether the airline passengers are
satisfied or not with the airline services.

• The dataset contains satisfaction levels of customers in various
departments such as cleanliness, legroom, seat comfort, etc. The dataset
also consists of continuous variables such as departure delay, arrival
delay, and flight distance.

• We will be pre-processing, visualizing our data to identify any relation
between predictor and response variables and choose the predictors
accordingly. We then build a prediction model, where the above
attributes are given as input and the output would be “satisfied” or
“dissatisfied” or “neutral”.

• Since the data is categorical and most of the variables are not continuous,
we can use random forest classification which is an ensemble model built
on decision trees. We will finally use classification metrics such as
sensitivity, specificity, accuracy to judge our model performance and
tweak the model’s parameters as necessary to improve the model’s
performance.
